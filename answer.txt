Question in Lab03:
- Try to add a method addDigitalVideoDisc which allows to pass an arbitrary number of arguments for dvd. Compare to an array parameter. What do you prefer in this case?
Ans: The addDigitalVideoDisc(DigitalVideoDisc... dvds) method is more convenient because it allows passing a variable number of DVD arguments directly without creating an array manually.
This improves usability and readability when the number of DVDs is unknown or varies.
In contrast, an array parameter requires additional steps to create an array before calling the method, which is less flexible.
Therefore, I prefer using varargs for this case.

Compare: With varargs, we don’t need to create an array when passing arguments, whereas an array parameter requires one. This makes varargs more convenient and readable. However, essentially, varargs are compiled into a hidden array, so we cannot declare both a varargs and an array parameter method with the same name and parameter type, since they would share the same method signature.

- Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language? 
Ans: Java is Pass-by-Value, but when passing objects, the value being passed is a copy of the reference to that object.
Hence, methods can modify the object’s data, but not which object the caller’s reference points to
