Question in Lab03:
- Try to add a method addDigitalVideoDisc which allows to pass an arbitrary number of arguments for dvd. Compare to an array parameter. What do you prefer in this case?
Ans: The addDigitalVideoDisc(DigitalVideoDisc... dvds) method is more convenient because it allows passing a variable number of DVD arguments directly without creating an array manually.
This improves usability and readability when the number of DVDs is unknown or varies.
In contrast, an array parameter requires additional steps to create an array before calling the method, which is less flexible.
Therefore, I prefer using varargs for this case.

Compare: With varargs, we don’t need to create an array when passing arguments, whereas an array parameter requires one. This makes varargs more convenient and readable. However, essentially, varargs are compiled into a hidden array, so we cannot declare both a varargs and an array parameter method with the same name and parameter type, since they would share the same method signature.

- Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language? 
Ans: Java is Pass-by-Value, but when passing objects, the value being passed is a copy of the reference to that object.
Hence, methods can modify the object’s data, but not which object the caller’s reference points to

●	After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
Ans: Because Java passes a copy of the reference (which is essentially pass-by-value), not the actual reference itself, swapping inside a method does not affect the original variable since it's only a copy of the original variable's value
●	After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
Ans: Although in the case above, Java does pass by reference, the variable dvd is not the actual object but merely a reference to the object (similar to a pointer in C++). Since the setTitle method modifies the content of the object, the title of jungleDvD is therefore changed.
