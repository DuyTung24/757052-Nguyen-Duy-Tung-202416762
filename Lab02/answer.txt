Question in Lab02:
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
The answer is NO. In Java, each constructor or method has a unique signature, which includes the name of the constructor and the parameter list (based on the order, type, and number of parameters, but not their names). Java distinguishes constructors (or methods) by their signatures. In the scenario above, the constructors have the same name (usually the same as the class) and identical parameter lists (both have a String type parameter), so their signatures clash.
