Question in Exercise 6.1:
-What happens if users choose “Cancel”?
Answer: A notification will appear "You've chosen: No"
-How to customize the options to users, e.g. only two options: “Yes” and “No”, OR “I do” and “I don’t” (Suggestion: Use Javadocs or using Eclipse/Netbean IDE help)
Answer: If you want to customize it yourself, you don’t use showConfirmDialog but instead use JOptionPane.showOptionDialog, which allows you to customize both the number of buttons and their labels.
